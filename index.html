        <h2>Halo Energy Sword</h2>
        <p><a href="img/energysword.jpg">Full Size Image</a></p>
        <p>This is a replica of an energy sword from the Halo franchise made from Mega Construx building blocks.  I built this replica in six hours after buying the set from Target.  It was a bit annoying with the massive instructions falling off the tiny table I used, putting together the 500+ pieces it was made of, etc., but I am pleased with the result.

        <h2>Snap Game</h2>
        <p><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=smrentfro&ProjectName=Game">Game</a></p>
        <p>In this Snap game, the goal is to pop as many balloons as possible.  When you pop a certain number of balloons, a floating eye pops up and starts trying to kill you.  Every time your score goes up, the balloons get slightly smaller and slightly faster.</p>

        <h2>Makecode DOOM Genius Hour Project</h2>
        <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vNZdYRSs7ED2rmtMm36svG9pn_koxPfN/view?usp=sharing">The Program</a></p>
        <p>This is one of my Genius Hour projects from the 2020-2021 school year.  It’s a program made for a Micro-Bit which, when loaded onto the Micro-Bit, will allow it to play E1M1-At DOOM’s Gate from the hit 1993 game DOOM.  One of the main struggles of this project was getting all of the notes correct.</p>

        <p><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=smrentfro&ProjectName=Drawing%20Project">The Game</a></p>
        <p>  This is the drawing program that I created as a project for the 2021 Congressional App Challenge.  It was really annoying to make and complete, because I accidentally deleted the entire thing when I was done with it and had to make almost the entire thing from scratch afterwards.
